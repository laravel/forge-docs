# Scheduler

[[toc]]

## Scheduled Jobs

Scheduled jobs may be configured to run commands at a specified interval. Forge provides several common defaults, or you may enter a custom Cron schedule for a command.

You can create scheduled jobs through the Forge dashboard via the **Schedule** tab for the server's management dashboard. When creating a new scheduled job, you'll need to provide:

- The command to run, for example `php /home/forge/default/artisan schedule:run`.
- The user to run the command as, for example `forge`.
- The frequency to run the command at.

:::warning Scheduled Job Not Running?

If your scheduled job is not running, you should ensure that the path to the command is correct.

### Laravel Scheduled Jobs

If you have deployed a Laravel application and are using Laravel's [scheduler feature](https://laravel.com/docs/scheduling), you will need to create a scheduled job to run the Laravel `schedule:run` Artisan command. This job should be configured to execute **every minute**.

### Default Scheduled Jobs

As part of the provisioning process, Forge will automatically configure two scheduled jobs:

- `composer self-update` (Nightly)
- Ubuntu package cleanup (Weekly)

## Circle Permissions

You may grant a circle member authority to create and manage scheduled jobs by granting the `server:create-schedulers` and `server:delete-schedulers` permissions.
