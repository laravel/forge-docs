# Circles

[[toc]]

## Overview

Forge circles allow you to collaborate with team members that may manage servers and sites on your behalf. You can create as many circles as you would like and add as many team members as needed to each circle.

:::warning Business Plan Only
Creating and managing Circles is only available on our "business" plan.

## Creating Circles

You may create a circle via the [Forge circle dashboard](https://forge.laravel.com/circles). To create a circle, you only need to provide a name.

## Managing Circles

Circles that you manage will be listed in the **Managed Circles** table.

### Editing Circles

You can edit a circle by clicking the "edit" button next to the circle's name. Editing a circle will allow you to:

- Rename the circle
- Select servers to share with circle members
- Select credentials to share with circle members

Shared servers can be managed by the circle members, but cannot be deleted on your behalf.

Shared credentials will allow servers to be created on your behalf. The servers will be created in **your** server provider's account.

### Managing Circle Members

You can manage access to circles by clicking the "user" button next to the circle's name.

To invite a new member to the circle, you only need their email address. If the email address provided doesn't match an existing Forge account, the user will be invited to create an account. The invited user may accept the invite from the same email.

### Deleting Circles

You can delete circles via the [Forge circle dashboard](https://forge.laravel.com/circles) by clicking the "delete" button next to the circle's name. You will be asked to confirm the deletion before it is actually deleted.

:::warning Circle Server Access

When deleting a circle, members will no longer be able to access shared servers or credentials.

## Accepting a Circle invite

When you are invited to a Circle you will receive an email with a link. You must use this link to accept the invite.

If you would like to see any pending Circle invitations you have, you may visit the [Circle dashboard](https://forge.laravel.com/circles) and see them listed under "Pending invites". Remember to check your email inbox in order to accept the invite.

## Leaving a Circle

You can leave a Circle that you are a member of by visiting the [Circle dashboard](https://forge.laravel.com/circles) and clicking the "leave" button next to the Circle's name.
